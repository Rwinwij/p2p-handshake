## Architectural Decision Record ðŸ”´

Lets record here all the relevant decisions for this project. This document is intended to change over time. Git history can be used to see its progression.

* The first implementation for the `p2p-handshake` project will be the [Bitcoin handshake](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch08.asciidoc#network_handshake). 
  * A low level, own TCP protocol message set, could be implemented by using something like the lower level [byteorder](https://github.com/BurntSushi/byteorder) crate. But in order to be more practical, lets try the [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) library. It looks perfect for the use case, as it already provides the network messages types, serialization and deserialization capabilities out of the box. The only problem is that [it still doesnt support](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/issues/1251) an `async` interface, so we will need to workaround the limitation of only accepting the sync version of [std::io::ReadBuf](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufReader.html#) on their principal decoding method, by using its low level functions.

* It will be a CLI. There are some parameters that can be tuned for both, the application execution and the handshake itself, like timeouts, protocol message fields values or even the verbosity of the log output. Being a CLI will make it more ergonomic for human interaction. We are going to use the [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/) crate for speeding up things and to provide a proper growth vector for the project.
  
* This tool is going to interact with the network. Thats an IO-bound task. in which certain concurrency/parallelism levels can be implemented for the initial planed handshake. So in order to speedup the process and to not block on resources, we will use one of the available async Rust runtimes ([async_std](https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/), [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) ...). That will also alleviate the overhead of creating native threads for processing network messages. It should be taken
  into account that only one task will be able to write to the socket at a given time, though.

* Its interesting to know whats happening during the execution of the handshake, events, timing among events, etc ...
  * Good, human/machine readable visual presentation should be taken into account. The [log](https://crates.io/crates/log) crate and a lightweight log implementation like [simple_logger](https://docs.rs/simple_logger/4.0.0/simple_logger/) could be used.
